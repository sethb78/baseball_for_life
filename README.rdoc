I am attempting to convert the fantasy baseball site I made using mostly PHP to Rails.

Steps:

  1.  created app
  2.  updated gemfiles based on my sample_app from Michael Hartlâ€™s book
  3.  configured Rails to use rspec
  4.  setup git repository
  5.  generated SitePages controller
  6.  routed to home page in confib/routes.rb
  7.  deleted public/index.html
  8.  created uploader.rb to upload data from tables in csv to sqlite
  9.  uploaded Yearly History, Team History, Member Info, and Power Rankings
