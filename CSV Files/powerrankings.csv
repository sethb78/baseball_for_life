Oh and don't forget they also have the innocent Ryan Braun. The pitching is anchored by arguably the best pitcher in baseball with Kershaw and Gallardo. There are a bunch of question marks after that, which can make things a little bumpy. The closers continue that scary trend, but so far both have held onto their roles and are getting some saves.

The Pence injury could be a majo issue because for all the good the infield has the outfield is the flipside. If Matt Joyce can keep things up that would be a big help, but I don't think his track record is long enough to make me feel that confident. A strong trio of pitchers with Cain, Haren and Greinke, that should all put up solid numbers, eventhough Haren and Greinke have started slow. The closers are suspect to put it nicely.

14,July 15-22,8,Matt Stockwell,68-64-8,11,3,"The offense finally checked back in for a week winning four of the categories. The numbers still weren't anything that special, but still a win is a win. The main key was Mark Teixeira who hit 4 of the teams 11HRs and recorded almost 1/3rd of the RBIs (11 of the 36). The pitching continues to be overall filthy. Francisco Liriano had 25Ks in 14IP with a 0.86 WHIP. That really isn't too bad, but sadly because he plays for the Twins he couldn't register a single victory.  
Deadline Status:  Well they are 4th in the standings so I guess they should be buyers. I don't know how they keep winning with this offense but they do. I would say go get a bat, but I have been saying that for over a month now, and they continue to stay in the top half of the standings so what do I know.",Mark Teixeira (5R/4Hrs/11RBIs/1.106 OPS),Michael Young (3R/0HR/3RBIs/.563 OPS)
14,July 15-22,9,Chris Mantione,62-66-12,4,-5,"MAYDAY!!! MAYDAY!!! I have lost control of the plane and am in a tailspin. My co-pilot, Jon Lester has been drinking on the job again. This week's debacle will do one of two things. 1) End the season for the Smackers or 2) Wake them up and be marked as a turning point in their season. The trading of Trumbo for Wainwright and Bailey was a bit extreme in my mind. That being said something extreme had to be done to fix the pitching so I respect the owner swallowing hard and doing the deal. If you want to look at a bright side… Edwin Encarnacion continues to bash.  
Deadline Status:  Borderline Buyers. Their offense is too good in my opinion to just close up shop. Bautista will be back and will be chomping at the bit. If they could get one more arm it would be a big help.",Edwin Encarnacion (7R/3HRs/9RBIs/1.295 OPS),Jon Lester (8IP/6Ks/19.13 ERA/3.00 WHIP)
14,July 15-22,10,Dave Majofsky,58-73-9,10,---,"A tough 6-4 loss continues to drop the Sucks organization futher down in the standings and further away from the last playoff spot. With a player like Bryce Harper on your team the future is bright. This season not so much. David Wright and Matt Holliday continue to do what they can but the only offensive stat the team grabbed was steals. On pitching Aroldis Chapman stepped up with 6 saves, each one needed in order to win the category. The injury to Joey Votto didn't come at a good time (although I guess it is never good to get injured).  
Deadline Status:  Sellers. They have players to sell that people will want. If anything this could lead to exciting times heading into next season for Suck Nation.",David Wright (5R/3HRs/7RBIS/1.098 OPS),Wandy Rodriguez (10IP/8Ks/0Wins/8.10 ERA/1.50 WHIP)
14,July 15-22,11,Jay Kondas,57-79-4,11,---,"As hard as this team has tried to work the waiver wire it might have just not been enough. Down years from guys like Mat Latos and Carlos Santana (who's potential is still there somewhere) and an extended scrotum injury to your #1 Draft Pick is a lot to deal with in one year. This past match-up was another rough one with one point losses in HRs, Steals, and Wins, although even if they had won those three categories they still would have lost the week. On the bright side RA Dickey and Lance Lynn seem to be legit SPs that could possibly anchor a team going forward (I still am not so sure about Lynn but his numbers cannot be ignored). Imagine if Kennedy, Garza and Latos had pitched to their potential along with these guys this year. That's really all you can do at this point.  
Deadline Status:  Sell. They have some players that could be packaged for a keeper. It just depends on if they can find the right team. The addition of Bruce is a nice piece to build around with CarGo heading into next year too.",Lance Lynn (13IP/15Ks/W/0.69 ERA/1.00 WHIP),Tyler Colvin (5R/0HR/1RBI/.448 OPS)
14,July 15-22,12,Jeff Stern,55-78-7,12,0,"Where the heck has this type of performance been all year. A convincing 9-1 victory in Week #14 for the TipToes, is something that has to at least get their fans attention. The pitching staff swept all five categories, so you know where their strength is. Do they have a run in them? Probably not, but who knows.  
Deadline Status:  Sellers. Teams need pitching. They have pitching. You do the math. ",Felix Hernandez (17IP/15Ks/0.53 ERA/0.71 WHIP - All Hail the King!),Carlos Pena (3R/HR/3RBIs/.368 OPS)
14,July 15-22,1,Seth B. Altshuler,84-47-9,2,1,"Mike Trout is really something. Not only did he register just as many or more steals than half the league last week, but he also posted an OPS over 1.000 with multiple homeruns and double-digit runs. The guy is insane. Well in my last posting (about a month ago) I had finally moved this team down a notch. How did they respond? Oh they just blasted the team that had taken over the throne by a 7-1-2 score, and reminding the league who the king is this year. While Trout keeps excelling he overshadows some other unsung heroes that deserve some props like Josh Willingham (4Hrs), and a superior pitching staff. The trio of Cliff Lee, Jordan Zimmerman and Madison Bumgarner allowed a total of 6ERs in 40IP. This team is balanced. It will see how where they go from here.  
Deadline Status:  Can the strong get stronger? It's America baby, so sure why not. The team is stacked so it is tough to find a weakness, but if I had to pick one I would go with SS. Although Bonifacio could solve that problem.",,
